pos system for a bar

Hello guys i'm creating an MIT pos system using laravel and crudbooster let me know if you want to give me a couple of hands
at this stuff; of course this project license basically allow you to modify, and do whatever you want with the software
By the way; this is my first github project so let me know if you have any kind of ideas.

This is the main idea; there is a bar that bar wants to buy a POS but they have a special requirement software has to be able
to let them count how many liquor has been used; for example let's say i made a vodka based cocktail of course i'm not goin' to
spend a whole bottle just in a beverage.

database has been structured by using laravel migrations so you just have to create a new database set-up your .env file and
you'll be almost ready to rock. 

Cheers and see you later guys.
