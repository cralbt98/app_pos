pos system for a bar

Hello guys i'm creating an MIT pos system using laravel and crudbooster let me know if you want to give me a couple of hands
at this stuff; of course this project license basically allow you to modify, and do whatever you want with the software
By the way; this is my first github project so let me know if you have any kind of ideas.

This is the main idea; there is a bar that bar wants to buy a POS, but they have a special requirement. Software has to be able
to let them count how many liquor has been used; for example let's say i've just made a vodka based cocktail, and of course i'm not goin' to spend a whole bottle just in a beverage so we've got to take that in count.

At this point POS System is able to let u add/edit/deelete products, categories, tables, and also add a new order i'm working ad this module 'cause this is the larger one other modules are just not that complex and you can set them up just in an afternoon by having the required knowledge.

database has been structured by using laravel migrations so you just have to create a new database set-up your .env file and
you'll be almost ready to rock. 

Cheers and see you later guys, and sorry about my english.
